SU Projects

This repository holds five final projects completed during the course of my time in the Applied Data Science program at the Syracuse University iSchool. Together they demonstrate achievement of the learning goals of the program.

Each sub-folder, labeled by course number, contains a "Description" file describing the files in the folder and the manner in which they may be reviewed.
